  <p><div class="intro">After 20 years in biology and healthcare, I got a job working in the IT industry and found that I <em>LOVE</em> it! I'm taking the Intro to Programming course with Epicodus to increase my skills and learn more.</div></p>
  <h2>Intro to Programming Projects</h2>
  <p>We were introduced to HTML and the software needed to write and store the projects we've worked on. I was familiar with Visual Studio, but Git and the GitHub repository were new. <em>It's only been a few weeks, but I've learned so much!</em></p>
  <p>The projects I have worked on are below:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><span: class="redtitle">Hello-World</span></li>
    <p>This exercise taught us the sequence of tasks we use to create and save every project in the GitHub repository. We also editied html for the first time.</p>
    <p>This was mostly about setup and familiarization with the process <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/hello-world">Hello World Exercise</a>.</p>

    <li><span class="orangetitle">GoodbyeFriends</span></li>
    <p>Instead of detailed instructions, this project gave simpler instructions for repeating the hello-world exercise.</p>
    <p>This was good practice <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/GoodbyeFriends">Goodbye Friends</a>.</p>

    <li><span class="yellowtitle">Cookie-Recipe</span></li>
    <p>We learned to clone an HTML page that was already written for this exercise. Editing spacing and indentation was fun. I learned how precise coding needs to be to be for the resulting project and those doing and reading the code. I also learned how easily and quickly this can get messy! My partner and I kept finding mistakes to fix.</p>
    <p>It was fun searching for things to fix in the <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Cookie-Recipe">Cookie Recipe</a>.</p>

    <li><span class="greentitle">Homepage-For-Kids</span></li>
    <p>This was my first time creating a webpage on my own. The assignment was to create a page about pets, but I don't like my pets. I decided to create one about my kids instead. I practiced exercises from later lessons on this page as well.</p>
    <p>I found some of my favorite kid images and wrote brief desceiptions of the little humans in my home for <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Homepage-For-Kids">Homepage For Kids</a>.</p>

    <li><span class="bluetitle">My-First-Webpage</span></li>
    <p>This exercise introduced us to block elements, tags, and lists. We editied a second page and learned to add the link.</p>
    <p>Here is the page containing the link to another page <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a>.</p>

    <li><span class="purpletitle">Paragraphs</span></li>
    <p>This page along with the Fido page in the same repository, introduced us to CSS and a way to begin adding colors and syle to our pages.</p>
    <p>It was satisfying to learn basic style options in <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>.</p>

    <li><span class="redtitle">BoringLecture</span></li>
    <p>This was our first practice with styling text with CSS on our own. </p>
      <p>I could give a boring lecture any time about herbalism and chose to write about weeds in <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/BoringLecture">Boring Lecture About Herbalism</a>.</p>

      <li><span class="orangetitle">Media-Query-Practice</span></li>
      <p>brief description</p>
      <p>Most people notice when a website doesn't work on their phone the way it does on their laptop. Our assignment to try editing our page for different screen sizes is at <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Media-Query-Practice">Media Query Practice</a>.</p>

      <li><span class="yellowtitle">BandWebsite</span></li>
      <p>One assignment topic for building a site with styling and adding media query elements was a band website. I decided to use the opportunity to create a website for a band my husband plays in. It didn't work very well, but it was a great opportunity to trouble-shoot and recognize how little I know.</p>
      <p> The failed mess of a website for D'LuJo is at <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/BandWebsite">D'LuJo Band Site</a>.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was interested in science from early childhood. Biology fascinated me and I was determined to be a microbilogist. I studied hard in school and joined the International Baccalaureate Program which was very accelerated and allowed me to study many subjects at the college level. I then went to a community college through the running start program to study microbiology. This allowed me to spend my summers at an internship in a pulmonary research lab at UCLA and realized research wasn't for me. I returned home and attended Massage School as a way into healthcare. When I was in my 30s, I studied herbalism at Bastyr University.</p>

  <div class="column">
    <p>I was invited to apply for a software testing position because of my detailed approach to problem solving and research-quality documentation practices. It was difficult to join a completely different industry, but I found that I love the work. I continued to take contracts with Microsoft to perform testing, manage small teams, train interns, develop test processes, and work with automation. Sadly, I don't have enough basic knowledge to apply my skills to another company. I'm learning programming at Epicodus so I can return to working with computers and continue working in the IT industry.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="finale">
    <p>My daily life now is focused on raising my four children. My older two are teenagers. They need a lot of help with school, friends, and the transition into young adulthood. My younger two are toddlers. Most of my time with them is spent changing diapers, feeding them, cleaning them, and cleaning their messes.</p>
    <p>Two of my kids have special needs. My healthcare experience has been invaluable in helping me care for them. My 13yo has Type 1 Diabetes and requires constant monitoring to keep her insulin and blood sugar levels in a healthy range. My 3yo has a blood disorder and a periodic fever syndrome. Both children have specialist teams and require lots of doctors visits and testing. Hopefully, after completing this course, I'll be able to find a remote job so I can have the flexible schedule I need to care for them.</p>
