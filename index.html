  <p>After 20 years in biology and healthcare, I got a job working in the IT industry and found that I <em>LOVE</em> it! I'm taking the Intro to Programming course with Epicodus to increase my skills and learn more.</p>
  <h2>These are the projects I have worked on so far:</h2>
  <p>We were introduced to HTML and the software needed to write and store the projects we've worked on. I was familiar with Visual Studio, but Git and the GitHub repository were new. <em>It's only been a few weeks, but I've learned so much!</em></p>
  <p>The projects I have worked on are below:</p>

  <ol>

    <li>hello-world</li>
    <p>This exercise taught us the sequence of tasks we use to create and save every project in the GitHub repository. We also editied html for the first time.</p>
    <p>This was mostly about setup and familiarization with the process <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/hello-world">Hello World Exercise</a>.</p>

    <li>GoodbyeFriends</li>
    <p>Instead of detailed instructions, this project gave simpler instructions for repeating the hello-world exercise.</p>
    <p>This was good practice <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/GoodbyeFriends">Goodbye Friends</a>.</p>
    
    <li>Cookie-Recipe</li>
    <p>We learned to clone an HTML page that was already written for this exercise. Editing spacing and indentation was fun. I learned how precise coding needs to be to be for the resulting project and those doing and reading the code. I also learned how easily and quickly this can get messy! My partner and I kept finding mistakes to fix.</p>
    <p>It was fun searching for things to fix in the <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Cookie-Recipe">Cookie Recipe</a>.</p>

    <li>Homepage-For-Kids</li>
    <p>This was my first time creating a webpage on my own. The assignment was to create a page about pets, but I don't like my pets. I decided to create one about my kids instead. I practiced exercises from later lessons on this page as well.</p>
    <p>I found some of my favorite kid images and wrote brief desceiptions of the little humans in my home for <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Homepage-For-Kids">Homepage For Kids</a>.</p>

    <li>my-first-webpage</li>
    <p>This exercise introduced us to block elements, tags, and lists. We editied a second page and learned to add the link.</p>
    <p>Here is the page containing the link to another page <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a>.</p>

    <li>Paragraphs</li>
    <p>This page along with the Fido page in the same repository, introduced us to CSS and a way to begin adding colors and syle to our pages.</p>
    <p>It was satisfying to learn basic style options in <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>.</p>

    <li>BoringLecture</li>
    <p>This was our first practice with styling text with CSS on our own. </p>
      <p>I could give a boring lecture any time about herbalism and chose to write about weeds in <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/BoringLecture">Boring Lecture About Herbalism</a>.</p>

      <li>Media-Query-Practice</li>
      <p>brief description</p>
      <p>Most people notice when a website doesn't work on their phone the way it does on their laptop. Our assignment to try editing our page for different screen sizes is at <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Media-Query-Practice">Media Query Practice</a>.</p>

      <li>BandWebsite</li>
      <p>One assignment topic for building a site with styling and adding media query elements was a band website. I decided to use the opportunity to create a website for a band my husband plays in. It didn't work very well, but it was a great opportunity to trouble-shoot and recognize how little I know.</p>
      <p> The failed mess of a website for D'LuJo is at <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/BandWebsite">D'LuJo Band Site</a>.</p>
