  <h2>List of projects I have created</h2>
  <p>We were introduced to HTML and the software needed to write and store the projects we've worked on. I was familiar with Visual Studio, but Git and the GitHub repository were new. <em>It's only been a few weeks, but I've learned so much!</em></p>
  <p>The projects I have worked on are below:</p>

    <li>hello-world</li>
    <p>This exercise taught us the sequence of tasks we use to create and save every project in the GitHub repository. We also editied html for the first time.</p>
    <p>This was mostly about setup and familiarization with the process <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/hello-world">Hello World Exercise</a>.</p>

    <li>GoodbyeFriends</li>
    <p>Instead of detailed instructions, this project gave simpler instructions for repeating the hello-world exercise.</p>
    <p>This was good practice <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/GoodbyeFriends">Goodbye Friends</a>.</p>
    
    <li>Cookie-Recipe</li>
    <p>We learned to clone an HTML page that was already written for this exercise. Editing spacing and indentation was fun. I learned how precise coding needs to be to be for the resulting project and those doing and reading the code. I also learned how easily and quickly this can get messy! My partner and I kept finding mistakes to fix.</p>
    <p>It was fun searching for things to fix in the <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Cookie-Recipe">Cookie Recipe</a>.</p>

    <li>Homepage-For-Kids</li>
    <p>This was my first time creating a webpage on my own. The assignment was to create a page about pets, but I don't like my pets. I decided to create one about my kids instead. I practiced exercises from later lessons on this page.</p>
    <p>I found some of my favorite kid images and wrote brief desceiptions of the little humans in my home for <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/Homepage-For-Kids">Homepage For Kids</a>.</p>

    <li>my-first-webpage</li>
    <p>This exercise introduced us to block elements, tags, and lists. We editied a second page and learned to add the link.</p>
    <p>Here is the page containing the link to another page <a href="https://github.com/TimnaSchulze/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a>.</p>
